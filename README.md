matching
========

<p>
In this project several algorithms are implemented solving the Stable Marriage Problem. 
</p>
<p>
The classic algorithm, suggested by Shapley and Roth, assures that given two preferences sets for two groups of entities (in the classic example
these entities are men and women) a stable matching will be found. Stability reassures that there will not exist two different couples that one partner 
from each (belonging to different groups: a man and a woman from different couples) will be motivated to release their current matching in order to mate
with each other. </p>

<p>
This classic algorithm (noted as SMA, Stable Marriage Algorithm) however, does not treat the two groups equally: one group is the proposer and the other group is the acceptor. This is why new algorithms are tried and (hopefully) proposed to address this issue. The target is to implement a parallel, scalable algorithm which provides a stable matching and also it treats the members of the different groups equally.
